# Pause dropbox during the process

# Make sure that the file .pypirc exists in the HOME folder
# Moreover, install requirements:
#   pip install auditwheel twine
#   apt install patchelf

# You have to build the wheel for multiple platforms and versions of python
# so it is recommended to use a ready-made docker image as follows:

# cd the folder where you want to build
# docker run -i -t -v "`pwd`":/io quay.io/pypa/manylinux_2_28_x86_64 /bin/bash
# within the docker image, run the following command:
# cd io
# python3.6 -m pip wheel . -w wheelhouse/
# python3.7 -m pip wheel . -w wheelhouse/
# python3.8 -m pip wheel . -w wheelhouse/
# ...

# then run auditwheel to repair the wheels:
# for whl in wheelhouse/*.whl; do     auditwheel repair "$whl" -w /io/wheelhouse2/ --plat=manylinux_2_34_x86_64; done


# now your files are ready to be uploaded to pypi
# in the host system, run the following command to upload the wheels:
# twine upload wheelhouse2/*.whl
